# odin-recipes
My first Odin Project
Introduction

Please go easy on me! This project is meant to practice what I learned in the first few foundations course on HTML. It will not be pretty but I will learn my weaknesses and hopefully get better at coding. 

Self Reflection
CSS styling is a bit challenging. I still need to figureout what the standard is for page resolution is and what screen sizes to accomdate. I'm hoping to learn more if it is not introduced in the odin project.
